Description: Genetic inteRaction and EssenTiality neTwork mApper (GRETTA) performs in-silico genetic screens and generate essentiality network maps. 
  To do this, GRETTA leverages publicly available data generated by the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project. Users can define versions of DepMap 
  to analyze, and can also query DepMap data directly from the tool. A manuscript with with detailed explanations on GRETTA has been published and can be found here:
